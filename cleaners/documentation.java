documentation?
so,a brief function and comments of what all files do,right now,and to do things in the future
index - default location,click to show login,register of new..users,and admin login
        Could remove the register button overall,since it is the work of the administrator,and it would be more or less fixed
        Or,could add the option for adding new bathrooms,new Incharges and new Engineers after the administartor logs in!
login - the login page for the ..staff(simply named users for now),has username and password option
register-Adds new users to the database
loginadmin-Logs in the administrator
home-the home for the staff,displays only the relevant stuff in a table for each user(prototype now,can easily be changed later)
homeadmin-home for administrator,the headers show what each index in each row is supposed to show.date and time can be added automatically
        Suggestions-create links from here to list of bathrooms,list of engineers,list of incharges,all interconnected,
        all can be edited,deleted and added to by the administrator easily.
edit-the page for editing forms for the user
editadmin-similar for the administrator(all are prototypes,can be duplicated for any number)
delete and deleteadmin and logout-do as their name suggests
checklogin and checkadminlogin are for authorizing the users
To do stuff-load all of this into a server,after creating(adding) the necessary front end(display).
